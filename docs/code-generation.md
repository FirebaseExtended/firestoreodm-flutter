# Code Generation

> The Cloud Firestore ODM is currently in **alpha**. Expect breaking changes, API changes and more. The documentation is still a work in progress. See the [discussion](https://github.com/firebase/flutterfire/discussions/7475) for more details.

The power of the ODM comes from code generation. The models created need to be run through
code generation to allow for the full type safety which the ODM offers.

When [defining models](./defining-models.md) we include a `part` declaration -
this declaration references a file which have not yet generated.

Within the root of your project, run the following command to run code
generation against the defined models:

```bash
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

During development, you can watch for changes and automatically update the
generated code:

```bash
dart run build_runner watch --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

This will generate files with the postfix of `.g.dart`, corresponding to the
file name of your model. For example:

- A model is defined within a file named `product.dart`.
- Code generation will create a file in the same directory named `product.g.dart`.
- Within the `product.dart` file, apply the part declaration (`part 'product.g.dart'`).

## Next steps

With our code generated, we can now start to [use the references](./references.md).
